        <h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p> For as long as I can remember I’ve been fascinated by the concept of G and E. Watching movies and reading books as a child it seemed that there was an obvious difference between the two. That even when it was less convenient and took more work, the smarter choice was always the Moral one. As obvious as this difference seemed though, the more people I asked, the more I realized that almost everyone had a different definition of what Goodness was. This struck me as troublesome. For the difference between the two was dramatic, and the consequences of justifying your actions in a way that did or didn’t align with someone else’s definition, could mean the difference between war and peace, between life and death (an early hint). </p> 
	    
	<p> As I grew up, I learned more about the E and chaos of the world. From climate change, to pollution, to nuclear war; there seemed to be no shortage of existential threats that this planet was facing. I wasn’t cynical, but these problems obviously weren’t just going to disappear overnight, and no one person could solve it all. The point remained as I grew older and more aware of the stakes, that humanity seemed fixed on an unfavorable trajectory. That something needed to change for Life to sustain itself through our future. That for humanity to collaborate more rationally and effectively through our most urgent challenges, some common ground on the question “What is Goodness?”, was needed to unite our understanding and hope for the world.</p>
		
	<p> Desperate for this answer I set off on a philosophical journey to uncover the truth of this great mystery, to discover the right order of words which would finally explain this millennia old question. To give humanity a fighting chance at working together, to maybe, just maybe find the right motivation to redeem ourselves for all of the harm that we’ve caused this planet- and for all the harm that we’ve caused each other. And this past April as I continued to chip away at this great mystery, I was struck by a fortunate series of clues that at last brought me to an answer that I found satisfying. An answer that cleared up the confusion of what I could reliably call “Goodness” and an answer which at last might prove that there was an up and a down in the moral realm. </p>
		
	<p> Here is my attempt to answer the question of G and E. To put to rest The moral question once and for all. If it is wrong, please tear it apart mercilessly- I welcome the challenge. If it is right, let it guide humanity forward through our current shortcomings and most pressing issues. Putting to rest once and for all the ignorance behind our struggles for Goodness. Let truth, sanity, and connection come from this explanation of ourselves. Let Evil never again seem seductive or justifiable… </p>

	<p> Let Goodness win for eternity. </p>

        <h2>Relevant Theory Background</h2>
	<p> 	The idea that morality could be universal is by no means a new concept. From Moses’ Commandments to Kant’s Categorial Imperatives, the framing of morality has primarily been that of a deontological, or rules based system. Where the determination of your moral worth was dependent on how strictly you could follow whatever set of rules you or someone else defined as being “Good”. While being a step forward from lawlessness, this framework had obvious logical flaws that presented just as many questions as answers.</p>
	    
	<p> 	It wasn’t until Bentham’s Utilitarianism in 1861 that a competing school of thought to Deontology was born which rivaled rule based morality, Consequentialism. This shifted the moral framework from an obedience to a calculation based system, where morally “Good” actions were ones which maximized or minimized the outcome (the consequence) of specific variables. In Bentham’s case the variable offered was pleasure, proposing the idea that Goodness could be defined as maximizing pleasure for the greatest number. This was a clear breakthrough in the evolution of moral understanding, solving some of the logical inconsistencies of a universal rules system and opening the door to a more flexible and dynamic moral framework. Utilitarianism had clearly solved some of deontology’s most glaring issues (covered in Sec. 4), and yet the proposed variables seemed to bring their own inconsistencies and problematic notions.</p>
	    
	<p> 	Along with these competing frameworks, in 1859 Charles Darwin published “On the Origin of Species”. This work identified the phenomenon of evolution while describing the possibility that morality may be fundamentally connected with our innate desire of survival(SOURCE). Thus the seed became planted that within our existing  frameworks, there might exist a principle of survival in our moral reasoning. Effectively also introducing the potential connection between the newly discovered laws of ecology, biology, and evolution with the concept of morality. </p>
	    
	<p> 	In the late 1950’s another huge philosophical breakthrough was made by the philosopher and linguist Noam Chomsky with the proposition of Universal Grammar. Universal Grammar is a theory that describes the presence of “invariable fixed structures” within our brain which allow the universal human phenomenon of language and grammar to exist(SOURCE). This theory radically shifted our universal perception of language, and thus Chomsky was popularly declared the “Father of Modern Linguistics”. Chomsky reasoned based off of his logic, that an invariable fixed structure might not be isolated to just our language faculty. That in all humans, mathematics and morality must also possess a similar innate structure. Chomsky thus coined what he called Universal Generative Morality, proposing that similar to language, an innate fixed structure governed our moral judgment.</p>
	    
	<p>	This was another huge step forward in the evolution of moral theory, bringing more credibility to the possibility of a Universal Moral framework which transcended sociopolitical lines and was embedded in each of our DNA. And while different philosophers and scientists would go on to explore Chomsky’s idea, trying to propose the right framework and rule set that could reliably explain a universal moral phenomenon, no major breakthroughs were made to bring this idea to light.</p>
	    
	<p> 	Inspired by these frameworks and the possibility of a Universal Morality, I present this work as an attempt to provide the definitive framework and principles under which not only the human innate phenomenon of morality may be explained, but also the basis of a universal moral force beyond humanity’s existence.</p>
	    
	<p>	This is Universal Moral Theory.</p>

        <h2>Lightbulb</h2>
        <p> 	After being presented with the idea that morality was connected to “S”, I began to realize that Moral Goodness was actually advantageous to “S”. That having moral people around you meant that you were physically safer than being in the presence of immoral people. This was an important, but not groundbreaking discovery. It wasn’t until an incident on a bus that I uncovered the key principle to this Theory.</p>

	<p>	On the bus there was a man with turrets who was shouting profanities at no one in particular. It made others uncomfortable but was obviously not within his cognitive realm of control. Across from him was a violent man who became disturbed by the profanity, and began shouting back at the man with turrets, threatening to hurt him unless he “Shut Up”. As the man remained unable to keep himself quiet, a close quarters brawl seemed imminent on the tightly packed bus. As the disturbed stranger began to step forward to silence the man with turrets, I spoke up (somewhat shakily, looking the man in the eye) to say “That’s not a fair fight”.	</p>

    	<p>	The stranger proceeded to ignore the man with turrets and turn his aggression towards me. Choosing to disengage I said “sure thing” and moved myself to another section of the bus. The violent stranger proceed to make a couple more threats, but the intervention had worked and the situation had been successfully de-escalated. I rode on to my stop and was heading to the connecting line, when I was stopped by a woman who had apparently been on that bus. She was an older woman with a crucifix around her neck and she told me emotionally that I was a “Good Man”.</p>

	<p>	This made me curious. Why did she believe this was true? She’d only known me from that one action and nothing else. So I returned to the idea of “S” when analyzing what could have led her to believe this. When it finally struck me- my intervention had not just increased the likelihood of “S” for the man with turrets. I had also effectively increased it for everyone on that bus who threatened to become pulled into a violent physical conflict in the bus’ close quarters. Morality it dawned on me, was intertwined with “S” of the “G”</p>

	<p>	This insight was my key to unlocking a new framework for describing the moral phenomenon, and still it presented new questions such as how “S” was evaluated, and in what way did one identify with a “G”. So I continued on this quest by taking long walks and challenging every idea here that I had gathered. Building slowly but surely a framework around this insight. Arriving finally at the answer and theory I now pose here. UMT: Morality is a C based on ___ your P G S</p>

        <h2>Challenge to Current Theories</h2>
        <p>	I present no challenge to Darwin’s evolutionary principle and rationality. There are libraries of information and evidence available to speak to the phenomenon of evolution. In establishing universal principles which occur independently of human existence, evolution is one such observable phenomenon. Evolution as describes the process of adaptation and biological change overtime, clearly applies not just to humanity’s development but also that of other species. Demonstrating that any form of life as we define it- is oriented to survival. That observable to all life at a fundamental level, is the d of s.</p>

	<p>	The issue with the a Generative Moral framework as Chomsky has proposed, is that it assumes that morality, like language, possesses numerous fixed moral rules (i.e. lying is immoral while telling the truth is “Good”). This language-like framework essentially tries to biologically integrate what Aristotle had done thousands of years prior by laying out an extensive virtue system which could describe the value of moral actions and which actions corresponded to positive outcomes. In essence Chomsky’s framework was again reverting back to the rationality of a deontological based system. It failed also to identify what underlying principle (S) was at work which consistently leads different cultures and groups to possess differing moral perceptions and judgments. Not integrating evolutionary logic also to connect morality to our ecological systems, and explain why other species (such as dolphins or elephants) possess empathy and what might be described as moral agency. </p> 

	<p>	Combining Kant’s Categorical Imperatives with religious commandment systems or tablet laws from ancient civilizations (because in essence they are all the same), we can revisit the classic counter argument to the framework of only living in accordance to strict moral rules: What if a man with an axe knocked on your door in the middle of the night, ready to chop off your head, asking if you or are loved one are home? Would it be immoral to lie by not coming forward to announce that either of you were in fact home and unarmed (should the attacker ask)? Or to not treat this individual as you would a neighbor, by offering for them to come inside and drink some tea? Of course not. There is clearly a rational basis to not follow strict ethical rules when it can keep yourself and others alive. Demonstrating that 1. “S” must be the motivating force and reason why a moral rule can become flexible, and 2. that following strict categorical imperatives for every single situation is not rational. </p>

	<p>	If that same axe wielding individual had showed up to the door with a life saving medicine for you, we would converesely consider that individual to be morally Good. This demonstrates Bentham’s point, that when evaluating a moral dilemma we must be making a calculation. That a moral decision is made in the context of a specific situation, and based upon the conditions of the situation there may be justification to not act in strict accordance with universal rules, but with maximizing the likelihood of an outcome. While a calculation like this may be related to strict ethical principles (such as keeping yourself and others alive), the method of achieving these outcomes through strict rules may not always be possible.</p>

	<p>	To further drive in the point, imagine a kidnapped individual stealing a kidnapper’s keys to unlock their chains. Now Kant would consider even this immoral because stealing is not something that you would want anyone to do, and yet doing this would clearly be morally justifiable as it minimizes the chance of an outcome which would lead to the trapped person’s unjust demise. In fact by stealing those keys that individual could (hypothetically), be in a situation where to save a burning building full of children and puppies- they must steal the keys and subdue the kidnapper. You may clearly try to live a life that doesn’t involve stealing or hurting others, and yet to not steal in this situation where there is the opportunity to save innocent lives from an Evil action, would make you partially responsible for not saving that building of defenseless Life, should you have the chance. Relying on fixed rules that don’t positively effect the S of L, such as stealing tools for escape in situations where you’ll be saving a L, therefore demonstrates the absurdity of adhering to any strict type of deontological system, morality therefore must be calculation based. </p>
	    
	<p>	If this is the case, then returning to the framework proposed by Bentham, morality can’t simply be an issue of pain and pleasure. What of the runner who experiences pain but satisfaction when running a victorious marathon, or the woman who gives birth to a beautiful healthy child after going through the pain of childbirth? Are those actions to be considered immoral simply by virtue of the lack of pleasure? Certainly not, this dichotomy is just as irrational as if it were happiness or sadness, contentedness or dissatisfaction- the only framework which might rationally fit with a moral instinct is “L” and “D”.</p> 

	<p>	Though if morality is a calculation for L and D, then what is the framework of this calculation?</p>

    </section>

    <section id="section5">
        <h2>Moral Calculations</h2>
        <p>	In each moral calculation there is an evaluation made based on the intention and effect of an action. If one person hurt someone else when they were trying to help them, that is evaluated differently than if that person was trying to hurt someone else and accidentally helped them. The difference of intention demonstrates the moral nature of the individual and how they might behave again in similar situations. Now of course who that “someone” being helped or hurt is, is also significant to the calculation, for they themselves possess their own intentions, moral nature, and therefore predictable patterns. By highlighting these invariable elements of a moral judgment it is possible to more clearly define a moral calculation framework, and therefore analyze what features are inherent to a moral calculation.</p>

	<p>	Each moral calculation relies on prediction. And while there are enough points to be made about the objective structure and nature of prediction to create a whole other paper entirely, for the sake of simplicity I will contextualize the general role of predictions just to the framework of a M C. A prediction I propose, may be defined as: The anticipation of a condition or outcome. In the case of a moral C, the condition most often refers to intention, while the outcome most often refers to the effect of an action. S has already been argued to be the principle that these evaluations are oriented to, so it is left to a prediction to estimate whether (given someone’s best available information and reasoning skills), that an action a) possesses a morally good or bad intention and b) has or will have a morally positive or negative outcome.</p>

	<p>	Predictions are guesses made through the use of our assumptions (“knowledge”) and logical reasoning. When making a moral judgment both on a situation which has happened and that which has not happened, we are making a prediction as to what the anticipated effects will be in response to the changing condition (action). Predictions in this way are not solely confined to the future, but any type of situation with an outcome which is not fully known to us. </p>

	<p>	To demonstrate let’s take the example of a wasp hive being removed from a local property. When deciding whether an exterminator should be called to remove the wasp hive, the owners are making a moral calculation (the survival of themselves, the wasps, and the local ecosystem). If the prediction made in this situation based on the available information and perspective, is that by removing this hive the owners will increase the safety of their family, pets, and invited guests- then in follows that this hive’s removal will be considered morally justifiable by the owners. However if it is revealed to them (by the exterminator or a local ecologist), that the hive is an integral part of the local ecosystem and removing it will threaten to cause substantial harm in other ways (e.g. leading an invasive species of flies to multiply at a dangerous rate) it would follow from this that preservation of the hive would instead be considered the more morally rational decision. </p>

	<p>	So what is the right answer in this example or other ones? Well there isn’t one. For who’s to say that by preserving that hive a local doctor who is incredibly allergic to wasp stings, couldn’t one day by chance be walking by and get stung and die, leaving other community members vulnerable and without healthcare. This line of hypothetical reasoning and guessing could go on infinitely in every direction. For predictions can only anticipate outcomes, they cannot 100% guarantee them. When considering any type of prediction there are always factors and unforeseen circumstances which will impact the reliability of the prediction. Forecasting the weather is such an example of how regardless of all of our best technology and techniques, we cannot guarantee a completely accurate prediction 100% of the time. Moral judgments/predictions are very much the same. Regardless of how sure we are of the outcome and S ramifications of an action, we cannot say for certain that every action will reliably lead to a more morally positive or negative outcome.</p>

	<p>	Now it doesn’t follow from this that this we shouldn’t try to make morally positive calculations, three day weather forecasts after all are still accurate 90% of the time. By using probability to the best of our ability, it is only logical that those with a morally good intention will act in ways which will predictably lead to morally positive outcomes. When holding ourselves accountable, it is only reasonable to do so for the predictable consequences of our actions. When making a moral calculation intention and effect combined with a prediction, therefore inform our moral judgment. We evaluate both the intention and outcome of a moral action separately, using prediction to determine the moral nature of the acting party, as well as the likely moral ramifications of their action. </p>

	<p>	Now that a moral clear moral framework has been established, how about we take a look at how moral calculations are made. </p>
