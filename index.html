        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>	For as long as I can remember I’ve been fascinated by the concept of G and E. Watching movies and reading books as a child it seemed that there was an obvious difference between the two. That even when it was less convenient and took more work, the smarter choice was always the Moral one. As obvious as this difference seemed though, the more people I asked, the more I realized that almost everyone had a different definition of what Goodness was. This struck me as troublesome. For the difference between the two was dramatic, and the consequences of justifying your actions in a way that did or didn’t align with someone else’s definition, could mean the difference between war and peace, between life and death (an early hint).</p>
	    
	<p>	As I grew up, I learned more about the E and chaos of the world. From climate change, to pollution, to nuclear war; there seemed to be no shortage of existential threats that this planet was facing. I wasn’t cynical, but these problems obviously weren’t just going to disappear overnight, and no one person could solve it all. The point remained as I grew older and more aware of the stakes, that humanity seemed fixed on an unfavorable trajectory. That something needed to change for Life to sustain itself through our future. That for humanity to collaborate more rationally and effectively through our most urgent challenges, some common ground on the question “What is Goodness?”, was needed to unite our understanding and hope for the world.</p> 
	    
	<p>	Desperate for this answer I set off on a philosophical journey to uncover the truth of this great mystery, to discover the right order of words which would finally explain this millennia old question. To give humanity a fighting chance at working together, to maybe, just maybe find the right motivation to redeem ourselves for all of the harm that we’ve caused this planet- and for all the harm that we’ve caused each other. And this past April as I continued to chip away at this great mystery, I was struck by a fortunate series of clues that at last brought me to an answer that I found satisfying. An answer that at last cleared up the confusion of what I believed Goodness to be, an answer that could confidently prove that there was an up and a down in the moral realm.</p> 

	<p>	Here is my attempt to answer the question of G and E. To put to rest The moral question once and for all. If it is wrong, please tear it apart mercilessly- I welcome the challenge. If it is right, let it guide humanity forward through our current shortcomings and most pressing issues. Putting to rest once and for all the ignorance behind our struggles for Goodness. Let truth, sanity, and connection come from this explanation of ourselves. Let Evil never again seem seductive or justifiable. Let Goodness win for eternity.</p>

        <h2>Relevant Theory Background</h2>
        <p>	The idea that morality could be universal is by no means a new concept. From Moses’ Commandments to Kant’s Categorial Imperatives, the framing of morality has primarily been that of a deontological or rules based system. Where the determination of your moral worth was dependent on how strictly you could follow whatever set of rules you defined as being “Good”. While being a step forward from lawlessness, this framework had obvious logical flaws that presented just as many questions as answers.</p>

	<p>	It wasn’t until Bentham’s Utilitarianism in 1861 that a competing school of thought to Deontology was born which rivaled rule based morality, Consequentialism. This shifted the moral framework from an obedience to a calculation based system, where morally “Good” actions were ones which maximized or minimized the outcome (the consequence) of specific variables. In Bentham’s case the variable offered was pleasure, proposing the idea that Goodness could be defined as maximizing pleasure for the greatest number. This was a clear breakthrough in the evolution of moral understanding, solving some of the logical inconsistencies of a universal rules system and opening the door to a more flexible and dynamic moral framework. Utilitarianism had clearly solved some of deontology’s most glaring issues (covered in Sec. 4), and yet the proposed variables seemed to bring their own inconsistencies and problematic notions.</p>

	<p>	Alongside these competing frameworks, in 1859 Charles Darwin published “On the Origin of Species”. This work identified the phenomenon of evolution while describing the possibility that morality may be fundamentally connected with our innate desire of survival. Thus the seed became planted that within our previous moral frameworks there might exist a principle of survival in our moral reasoning. Effectively also introducing the potential connection between the newly discovered laws of ecology, biology, and evolution with existing ethical frameworks. </p>

	<p>	In the 1960’s another huge philosophical breakthrough was made by the philosopher and linguist Noam Chomsky with the proposition of Universal Grammar. Universal Grammar is a theory that describes the presence of “invariable fixed systems” within our brain which allow the universal human phenomenon of language and grammar to exist. This theory radically shifted our universal perception of language, and thus Chomsky was popularly declared the “Father of Modern Linguistics”. Chomsky reasoned based off of his logic, that an invariable fixed structure might not be isolated to just our language faculty. That in all humans, mathematics and morality must also possess a similar innate structure. Chomsky thus coined what he called Universal Generative Morality, proposing that similar to language, an innate fixed structure governed our moral judgment.</p>

    	<p>	This was another huge step forward in the evolution of moral theory, bringing more credibility to the possibility of a Universal Moral framework which transcended sociopolitical lines and was embedded in each of our DNA. And while different philosophers and scientists would go on to explore Chomsky’s idea, trying to propose the right framework and rule set that could reliably explain a universal moral phenomenon, no major breakthroughs were made that brought this idea to light. </p>
   
    	<p>	Inspired by these frameworks and the possibility of a Universal Morality, I present this work as an attempt to provide the definitive framework and principles under which not only the human innate phenomenon of morality may be explained, but also the basis of a universal moral force beyond humanity’s existence.</p>

	<p>	This is Universal Moral Theory.</p>
