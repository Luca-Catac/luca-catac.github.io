        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>For as long as I can remember I’ve been fascinated by the concept of G and E. Watching movies and reading books as a child it seemed that there was an obvious difference between the two. That even when it was less convenient and took more work, the smarter choice was always the Moral one. As the years went by I grew curious *about this distinction, realizing that many different people had many different definitions for what Goodness was. This struck me as troublesome. For that difference between the two was dramatic, and the consequences of justifying your actions in a way that did or didn’t align with another’s could mean the difference between life and death (an early hint). 

	I was more naive and idealistic then, expecting a type of moral perfection from the world. Thinking that one day the people around me might suddenly wake up and fix all of the chaos around us, putting humanity on a hopeful path forward. But the point remained as I grew older and more aware of the stakes, that humanity seemed fixed on an unfavorable trajectory. That something needed to change for Life to sustain itself through our future. That for humanity to collaborate more rationally and effectively through our most urgent challenges, some common ground on the question “What is Goodness”, was needed to unite our understanding of the world.

	Desperate for this answer and personal grounding I set off on a philosophical journey to uncover the truth of this great mystery, to discover the right order of words which would finally explain this millennia old question, and give us a fighting chance at working together to maybe, just maybe, give humanity the right motivation to redeem ourselves for all of the harm that we’ve caused this planet. For all the harm we’ve caused each other. And this past April, as I continued to chip away at this great mystery, I was struck by a fortunate series of clues that at last brought me to an answer that I found satisfying. An answer which addressed all of the mystery and confusion I had trying to identify up from down in the moral realm. 

	Here is my attempt to answer THE Moral Question once and for all. If it is wrong, please tear it apart mercilessly- I welcome the challenge. Though if it is right, let it guide humanity forward through our current shortcomings and pressing issues. Putting to rest once and for all the mystery behind our struggles for Goodness. Let truth, sanity, and connection come from this explanation of ourselves. Let Evil never again seem seductive and justifiable. Let Goodness win for eternity. .</p>
